Image Compression
Image compression is the process of reducing the size of an image file by eliminating redundant or unnecessary data, while preserving the essential information and visual quality of the image. It involves transforming the original image data into a more compact form, making it possible to store or transmit the image more efficiently. Image compression algorithms aim to minimize the number of bits required to represent the image, while maintaining an acceptable level of image quality.

Methods of Image Compression:
Lossless Compression:
Lossless compression methods compress the image data without discarding any information. The compressed image can be restored to its original form without any loss of quality.
1. Run-Length Encoding (RLE): RLE replaces sequences of identical pixels with a single value and a count of the number of times it appears in the sequence.
2. Huffman Coding: Huffman coding assigns shorter codes to frequently occurring pixel values, reducing the overall size of the image data.
3. Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) Coding: LZW coding builds a dictionary of frequently occurring patterns in the image data and replaces them with a reference to the dictionary entry.
4. Arithmetic Coding: Arithmetic coding encodes the image data by calculating the probability of each pixel value and representing it as a fractional value.
Lossy Compression:
Lossy compression methods discard some of the image data to reduce its size. The compressed image may lose some of its original quality, but it can still be acceptable for certain applications.
1. Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT): DCT is a widely used lossy compression method that separates the image into frequency components and discards the less important ones.
2. Fractal Compression: Fractal compression represents the image as a set of self-similar patterns, reducing the amount of data required to store the image.
3. Wavelet Compression: Wavelet compression represents the image as a combination of low-frequency and high-frequency components, allowing for selective discarding of the high-frequency components.
4. Transform Coding: Transform coding applies a mathematical transformation to the image data, such as the DCT, and then quantizes the transformed coefficients to reduce their precision.
5. Predictive Coding: Predictive coding predicts the value of a pixel based on the values of neighboring pixels and encodes the difference between the predicted and actual values.
Hybrid Compression:
Some image compression algorithms combine lossless and lossy techniques to achieve a balance between compression ratio and image quality. Examples include:
1. JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group): JPEG uses a combination of DCT, quantization, and Huffman coding to achieve high compression ratios.
2. WebP (Web Picture): WebP uses a combination of predictive coding, transform coding, and entropy coding to achieve efficient compression of images on the web.
3. HEIC (High Efficiency Image Format): HEIC uses a combination of transform coding, predictive coding, and entropy coding to achieve high compression ratios and efficient compression of images.
